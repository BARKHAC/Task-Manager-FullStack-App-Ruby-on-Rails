# README

This application runs on Ruby 3.1.6, Ruby on Rails 7 and uses MySql as the database.

Notable: This application was built using Windows Subsystem Linux, with Ubuntu 22.1 installed. 

Installation: Configure WSL if using Windows, install your preferred distro. Install the bash command on Windows, download and set up Ruby to the latest version, I went through a couple of trial and errors to set up Ruby and shall be updating this Readme.md with the method that worked best. Download and set up Ruby on Rails within your distro, used from the Terminal. For a beginner MySql might be the easiest db to work with, I recommend using MySql for your first project as it fairly easy and straightforward to work with.
